#React Face Detection Video Player

Welcome to the React Face Detection Video Player repository! This web-based video player is built using React, Fabric.js, and Face-api.js. The player enables users to upload videos, renders them on a Fabric Canvas, and provides essential playback controls. To enhance the user experience, we've integrated Face-api.js to detect faces within the video, utilizing Fabric.js to draw rectangles around them.
